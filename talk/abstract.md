# Iteration Scales

Audience: intermediate, python

## Abstract

Small changes and repeated machine-driven rinsing, is a programming workflow
that works really well for me.

We'll take a look at my personal preferences for a perfectly productive python
programming environment, as we iterate through the development of a trick-based
card game called Thunee.

The presentation consists primarily of reading and writing code
(LARGE and Solarized, I know...), while watching terminal output and receiving
automated continuous integration reports.
